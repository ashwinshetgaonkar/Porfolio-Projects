* The Dataset contains information of number of deaths in various regions of the World from 1990-2019,along with other data like historical population,region code,Side of driving.

* My objective for this Project was to visualize the available data to draw insights from it which are not perceived just by reading through an excel/csv file.
* Here I have visualized the number of deaths using various plots to gain various insights from the data.
* From this I can easily state the regions with maximum,mean deaths,year in which max deaths occured and many more.
