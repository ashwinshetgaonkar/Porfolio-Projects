* Web scraping or web data extraction is data scraping used for extracting data from websites,this involves fetching data and extracting/parsing required info from it. Fetching is the downloading of a page (which a browser does when a user views a page).
* My objective for doing this project was to learn and implement web scraping on static sites.
* In this I have used requests and BeautifulSoup libraries to perform the web scraping.
* The project involves extracting the names of all topics of quotes and then scraping quotes along with their author name for all topics
  previously scraped.<br>
