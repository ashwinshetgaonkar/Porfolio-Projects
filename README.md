* The Indian Premier League is a professional men's Twenty20 cricket league, contested by ten teams based out of ten Indian cities.The league was founded by the Board of Control for Cricket in India in 2007.
* The Dataset contains the stats of all the batsman to have played the league from 2008 upto 2021.
My objective for this Project was to unearth various useful insights from the available data that would help teams owners / people playing fantacy games get information about players that are leading in various batting stats like :
- Players with max Strike Rate.
- Players with least balls/boundary.
- Players with most runs per season and many more.<br>

Around 35 of such criterions are used to visualize the data which will give almost all the key attributes of batting.<br>












# [3.Road Deaths Analysis](https://github.com/ashwinshetgaonkar/Data-Visualization-Projects/tree/main/Road%20Deaths%20Analysis)
* The Dataset contains information of number of deaths in various regions of the World from 1990-2019,along with other data like historical population,region code,Side of driving.

* My objective for this Project was to visualize the available data to draw insights from it which are not perceived just by reading through an excel/csv file.
* Here I have visualized the number of deaths using various plots to gain various insights from the data.
* From this I can easily state the regions with maximum,mean deaths,year in which max deaths occured and many more.
